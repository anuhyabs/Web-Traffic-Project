## DATASET SIZE:
The dataset consists of approximately 145k time series.

## DATASET DESCRIPTION:
Each of these time series represent a number of daily views of different Wikipedia articles, starting from July, 1st, 2015 up until December 31st, 2016.
The dataset has 804 columns â€“ except the first column, each column represents a date and the daily traffic for that particular Wikipedia page. 
The first column contains the name of the page, the language of the page, type of access and agent 

## CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND:
Analysis and forecasting web traffic has many applications in various areas. It is a proactive approach to provide secure, reliable and qualitative web communication.
Web traffic can be defined as the amount of data sent and received by visitors to a website. In recent years, emphasis on how to predict traffic of web pages has 
increased significantly. Predicting web traffic can help web site owners in many ways including: 
(a) determining an effective strategy for load balancing of web pages residing in the cloud
(b) forecasting future trends based on historical data
(c) understanding the user behaviour. 
Wikipedia is a multilingual free content online encyclopaedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers through a model of open collaboration, using a 
wiki-based editing system. Wikipedia grants open access to all traffic data and provides lots of additional (semantic) information in a context network besides 
single keywords. Wikipedia is often used for deep topical reading.

## GOALS:
1.	Grouping the data based on the language of the page and seeing if there exist any interesting patterns in web traffic based on language patterns. (ex: English, French, Chinese)
2.	Forecasting future traffic for each page as well as for each language of the web pages as a group.

## MOTIVATION
I am interested in this project as it helps me understand the underlying principles of timeseries forecasting by applying them on a real world web traffic model. 
I believe that by understanding this I can also use such models in various other applications such as vehicle traffic forecasting, network packet forecasting etc.
